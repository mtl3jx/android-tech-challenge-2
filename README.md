## Overview
In this tech challenge, you will be creating an app that displays a list of earthquakes retrieved by the U.S. Geological Survey. Selecting an item in the list will allow the user to folow a link to further infromation on the USGS website in their browser.

## Learning Objectives
When completed the student should have an understanding of the following concepts:

* HTTP request and response handling
* JSON parsing
* String manipulation
* Display theming and modifications including custom table rows
* Table row manipulation

## Prerequisites
Before starting this tech challenge, a student should be familiar with the follow concepts and have the following environment

* All prior Android Assignments are completed
* The Android SDK installed on the development device
* Android Studio (the latest stable release) installed on the development device

## Grading Criteria
Here are some specific requirements the graders will be looking for in your submission in order for your submission to be accepted:

The application must do the following:

* Retrieve historical earthquake data from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and produce a table displaying information about earthquakes that have occurred in the past 30 days. The recommended approach section has a URL for the data.
* The view of earthquake events must be sorted in descending date order.
* Each item must display the following information in a pleasing and easy to read format:
    * The USGS title for the quake
    * The latitude and longitude of the quake
    * The time the quake occurred in local time
* The user must be able to force a reload of the view.
* When the user reloads the view, the server should be re-queried and the view reloaded with all quake data received from the server
* The user must be able to selectively delete table items using a gesture familiar to uses of that platform.
* If the user selects a row the app should open an internal web browser control (native only) with a link to the full quake information at the USGS site.
* The items with an earthquake of magnitude 5 or higher must be shaded in light red.
* The items with a quake of magnitude 7 or higher must be shaded in red.
* The application must cleanly and correctly handle network failures or the absence of a network.
* The application must display some indicator that the application is busy during data loads.
* The application UI must remain responsive to user input during the data load process.
* The application must not crash or leak memory.
* The structure of the application must be well structured and understandable.
* If youâ€™re completing this task using the mobile web technology, there may be no server side logic other than delivery of HTML/JS/CSS content to the phone. All other logic, storage, etc. must occur on the phone itself.

## Submission Instructions
Please provide these specific items when submitting your tech challenge, placing them inside of your repository where your grader can easily find them:

* An application that meets the above requirements running on the target mobile device is required for completion of this assignment. Please place the `.apk` file of the completed app in the base directory of your repository.
* The code for your submission should be at the base directory of the repo, or within a specified child directory.

### Git Workflow
* When you start a tech challenge, the tech challenge admin will create a private repository for you.
* There will be two branches in the repo, `master` and `develop`.
* Do all your work in the `develop` branch.
* As you work, push your changes up to your GitLab repo.
* When you are finished, make a merge request to the `master` version of your private repo.
* At this point, the graders will review your merge request and offer comments where needed.
* You may be asked to push updates, corrections to your develop branch in response to the coments by graders. You `don't` need to create another merge request.
* When the grader is satisfied, he will merge your code into the master branch of your private repo.
* Now celebrate, the Tech Challenge is completed!
